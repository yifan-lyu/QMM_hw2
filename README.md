# Paper replication: simplified version of Khan & Thomas (2007)

This is the second homework of QMM II course. The matlab file is organised in the following way:

1. main.m is the main file to run.
2. func.m collects all miscellaneous functions that are used in main.m
3. redundant.m collects some code that is not used in the main.m but may becomes useful.

# folders
1. Graph folder and latex folder are independent of the main.m
2. Fortran folder is the Fortran code of the orginal paper.
